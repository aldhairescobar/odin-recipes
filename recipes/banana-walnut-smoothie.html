  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>In this thick drink, the slight bitterness of walnuts perfectly balances the creamy sweetness of bananas.  Plus, it’s got enough protein to power you through the morning. Kids Advisory Board member Hannah recommends topping the smoothie with an extra sprinkle of cinnamon.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 overripe banana, peeled and sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1⁄2 cup milk or water</li>
    <li>1⁄2 cup toasted walnuts</li>
    <li>2 ice cubes</li>
    <li>1⁄8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>pinch kosher salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put all the ingredients in the blender.</li>
    <li>Put the top on tightly. Turn on the blender to medium speed and blend until the mixture is smooth, 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
    <li>Divide the smoothie equally between the 2 glasses and serve right away, or, if you want to drink the smoothie later, cover and refrigerate up to 4 hours. *If you are allergic to walnuts, leave them out of the recipe.</li>
  </ol>
