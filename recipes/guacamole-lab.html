  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>We call this a lab instead of a recipe because you’re going to be experimenting! What are the flavors you like best in your guacamole? Add them! If you’re not sure, put a spoonful of the guacamole on a plate, then add just a pinch of your chosen spice or ingredient.</p>
  <p>If you like it, consider seasoning the whole batch that way. Serve the guacamole with whole-grain chips or vegetables for dipping—or use it to top nachos, tacos, burritos, or quesadillas.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 perfectly ripe avocado, peeled, pitted, and cut into large chunks</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put the avocado in the bowl and mash it with the fork until it has the texture you like best.</li>
    <li>Add the lime juice, salt, and any additional ingredients you like (see below) and mash again. Taste the guacamole. Does it need a bit more seasoning or a squeeze more lime juice? Add it and then taste again. Serve right away.</li>
  </ol>
