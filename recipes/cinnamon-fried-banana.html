  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These golden-sweet slices smell fantastic when they're cookingâ€”and they taste even better! Eat them plain, or use them as a cinnamon-y pancake or French-toast topper.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 just-ripe bananas, peeled and sliced</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put the butter, honey, and cinnamon in the skillet and turn the heat to medium. When the butter has melted, mix well.</li>
    <li>Carefully add the banana slices and cook until they are golden, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn the slices over and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer the bananas to the plate and serve right away.</li>
  </ol>
